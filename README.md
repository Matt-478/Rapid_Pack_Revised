It is the Capstone Project to finish my Front-End course at Strive School.

### Walkthrough

**Home page**    
We will start our journey on the home page. There are four boxes that let us decide the city right away. The search bar at the top of the page should receive a name of a country, region or ideally a city. When the search input box receives a string that query name is used to fetch some information from Wikipedia that will be displayed right away under the search bar along with the name of the region we just typed. Under this information we will find a mix of media - both photos and videos, for the query we wrote. The videos sometimes need a bit longer to load, nevertheless the visual experience will accompany us through it all. These images are coming from the Pexels API
