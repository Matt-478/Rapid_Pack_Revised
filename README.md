# RapidPack

### Description
RapidPack is a platform that inspires you to go on spontaneous adventures by showing you the world through others eyes.
It is the Capstone Project to finish my Front-End course at Strive School.

### Walkthrough

**Home page**    
We will start our journey on the home page. There are four boxes that let us decide the city right away, but they're still a work in progress. The search bar at the top of the page should receive a name of a country, region or ideally a city. When the search input box receives a string that query name is used to fetch some information from Wikipedia that will be displayed right away under the search bar along with the name of the region we just typed. Under this information we will find a mix of media - both photos and videos, for the query we wrote. The videos sometimes need a bit longer to load, nevertheless the visual experience will accompany us through it all. Once we go through the list of photos and videos fetched from the Pexels API, we have a button at the bottom of the page, when pressed it'll take us to the flight page.

**Flight page**   
This page displays flight options based on price (ascending order). For now the base location is Paris, but in time we'll be able to change that as well. At the top of the page we have multiple inputs that let us customise our flight details. This is a feature that I'm currently working on and predict to be done before Jan 3rd, 2022. When clicking on individual flight cards we'll see a bit of information and a button "buy" - when clicked it will give us a modal that asks for our email. When we put in our info, it'll say that the information will be in our email, however that's all it does, there is no information sent to our email, because this is just a mock buy button and there are no more feature plans for the button as the focus of the application is based on giving us visual info on the place.
